# CRM System Template

This is a CRM system template created with React Admin library. The basic idea of this system is to manage customers' ordering workers to work at a chosen location they own.

## Current Status

First draft of the frontend created with views for customers, workers, locations and orders.

In the near future, I am planning to implement new features:

- User roles for customers and workers.
- Backend created with NestJS
